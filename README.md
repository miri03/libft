## *Libft - My Custom C Library*

This is my first project as a student in 1337. 
Libft is a custom C library that aims to reimplement many of the highly useful standard functions found in C.
This project is designed to help us understand how these functions work under the hood, enhance our C programming skills, and provide a set of utilities that can be used in our future projects.
